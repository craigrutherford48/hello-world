# hello-world
This is my 3rd attempt at starting a project.

My name is Craig Rutherford and I am a computer science teacher at Eastwood High School. However, I know almost nothing. This is my attempt to learn something.

I deleted a line of code and replaced it with this line so that I could see how the merges would work.
